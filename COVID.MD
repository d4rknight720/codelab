 # Testing

 ## Testing for COVID-19

 [Guidance on interpreting COVID-19 Test Results](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf): A guide for interpreting test results and determing what actions to take,

 Two kinds of test are available for COVID-19: [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html),

 * A viral test tells you if have current infection.
 * An antibody test tell you if you had a previous infection

 An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last

 ## Who should be tested

 To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used, But not everyone needs this test

 * Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested
 * CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisiobs about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department healthcare providers
 * If you have symptons of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
 * You can also visit your state or local health department's website to look for the latest local information on testing.
 * Although supplies of test are increasing, it may still be diffcult to find a place to get tested.

 ## Results

 * If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter what the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and other](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html),

# Test for current infection

Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to  [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

## How to decide if you should get a viral test

Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help youmake decisions about getting viral test

* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not need to be tested.
* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19.

CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisiobs about testing are made by state and local health departments or healthcare providers.

## How to get a viral test

COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a [nasal swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) or a [saliva sample](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-using-home-collection-saliva) at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
