# Symptons Of Coronavirus

## What You Need to know

* Anyone can have mild to sever symptons
* Older adults and people who have sever underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabets seem to be at higher risk for developing morse serious complications from COVID-19 illness

## Watch for Symptoms

People with COID-19 have had a wide range of symptons- ranging fromm mild sympotns to severe illness.

Symptoms may appear 2-12 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19

* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
* Fever
* Chills
* Muscle pain
* Sore throat
* New loss of taste or smell

This list is not all possible symportns. Other less common sympots have been reported, including gastroitestinal symptons like nause, vomiting, or diarrhea

## When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention
 
Look fr emergency warning signs* for COVID-19, if someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately

* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion
* inability to wake or stay awake
* Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all possible sympotons. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who may have COVID-19.

 # Testing

 ## Testing for COVID-19

 [Guidance on interpreting COVID-19 Test Results](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf): A guide for interpreting test results and determing what actions to take,

 Two kinds of test are available for COVID-19: [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html),

 * A viral test tells you if have current infection.
 * An antibody test tell you if you had a previous infection

 An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last

 ## Who should be tested

 To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used, But not everyone needs this test

 * Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested
 * CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisiobs about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department healthcare providers
 * If you have symptons of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
 * You can also visit your state or local health department's website to look for the latest local information on testing.
 * Although supplies of test are increasing, it may still be diffcult to find a place to get tested.

 ## Results

 * If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter what the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and other](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html),

# Test for current infection

Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to  [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

## How to decide if you should get a viral test

Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some information that might help youmake decisions about getting viral test

* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not need to be tested.
* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19.

CDC has [guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisiobs about testing are made by state and local health departments or healthcare providers.

## How to get a viral test

COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a [nasal swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) or a [saliva sample](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-using-home-collection-saliva) at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.

## What to do after a viral test 

To get your test result, please check with the group that performed your test, such as your healthcare provider or your health department. Check the CDC website to [locate your health department information](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html). How long it will take to get your test results back depends on the test used.

* **If you test positive for COVID-19**, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).

* **If you test negative for COVID-19**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later. This means you could still spread the virus.

# Test for Past infection

Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose COVID-19. To see if you are currently infected, you need a viral test. Viral tests identify the virus in samples from your respiratory system, such as swabs from the inside of your nose.

Antibody test are available through healthcare providers and laboratories

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

## How to get an antibody test 

Check with your healthcare providers to see if they offer antibody tests,

## How to get an antibody test

### If you test positive 

* A positive test result shows you have antibodies that likey resulted from an infection with SAR-CoV-2, or possible a related coronavirus
* its unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again, This mean that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to that virus
* if you have no symptons, you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed.
* if you have [symptons](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) you would need another type of test called nucleic acid test, or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). This tesr uses respiratory samples such as a swab from inside yorur nose to confirm COVID-19. An antibody test cannont tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.
* its possible you might test positive fir antiboides and you might have or have ever had symptons of COVID-19. This is known as having an asymptamatuc infection or an infection without symptons

### If you test negative 

* if you test negative for COVID-19 antibodies, you probably did not have a previous infection that has got better. However, you could have a current infecion. it's possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently, since antibodies dont show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection. this means you could still spread the virus.
* some people may even take longer to develop anibodies and some people may not develop antibodies
* if you have [symptons](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhcp%2Fclinical-criteria.html) you would need another type of test called nucleic acid test, or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html).
